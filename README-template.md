## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap 

### What I learned

This was a great opportunity to work with Bootstrap Cards which were then customised with CSS.
```html
<div class="container">
      <div class="card-group">
        <div class="card sedan">
```
The CSS complexity in this challenge was with applying card-specific border radii in the mobile version.
```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px){
  .card-text{
    margin-bottom: 15%;
  }
  .sedan{
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  }
  .suv{
    border-radius: 0;
  }
  .luxury{
    border-radius: 0 0 10px 10px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to improve the speed with which I develop these components and also come up with a workflow for ensuring I achieve speed and reduce time debugging.
